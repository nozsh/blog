Most likely, you're getting noise or just a blank instead of a beautiful image when trying to generate with the Flux model in [Stable Diffusion web UI by AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui?sl).

Or maybe you're get error **"You do not have CLIP state dict!"** when using the Flux model on another panel.

And that's probably why you're reading this.

{{< callout/warn >}}
This is note about how to run the **Flux** model.<br> **Not tutorial on setting up local installation for image generation.**
{{< /callout/warn >}}

{{< embedPost url="local-ai-image-generation-stability-matrix">}}

If you're getting noise or blank image, that means your panel doesn't support Flux models.

As of the time of writing, Flux works in [WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge?sl) and [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI?sl), both of which are listed in the [Stability Matrix](https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix?sl). Also, for now, Flux models work best with NVIDIA GPUs.

{{< callout/note >}}
The **optimized version** of the original Flux model, available [here](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/flux1-dev-bnb-nf4?sl), can run out of the box on WebUI Forge.

Because, all the necessary encoders and VAE are already [built-in](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/discussions/981?sl).
{{< /callout/note >}}

{{% details/1 "Models" %}}
You can download original models from [here](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev?sl) or [here](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell?sl).

**GGUF versions** are available [here](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/FLUX.1-dev-gguf?sl) or [here](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/FLUX.1-schnell-gguf?sl).

When running Flux models (or any other models based on Flux), you might run into this error:

```
You do not have CLIP state dict!
```

This happens because the **text encoder** is missing. Someone refer to it as **CLIP**, though technically they're slightly different things.

To make Flux model running, you'll need to download the encoders and VAE.

Download encoders, **clip-l\*** and **t5\*** [from here](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/tree/main?sl).

{{< callout/note >}}
Whether you should use **fp8** or **fp16** depends on your hardware.

If you have low VRAM (4-8GB) and limited RAM (8-16GB), use **fp8**.

If you have mid-range VRAM (11-12GB) and a lot of RAM (32GB+), you can use **fp16**.

If you have plenty of everything, especially VRAM (20GB+), just go with **fp16**.
{{< /callout/note >}}

Now, download the VAE files: `vae/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors` and `ae.safetensors` from [here](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev/tree/main?sl) or [here](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell/tree/main?sl).

Place VAE into `models\VAE`, and encoders into `models\text_encoder` or `models\CLIP` (if you're using Stability Matrix).

Now all that's left is to load the VAE and encoders from the menu.

![Load VAE & Text Encoder Menu](@img/001-start-flux-model-local-load-vae-text-encoder-clip.avif)

You can load them in any order.
